Problem 6 :
b) sigma = 0.1 T1=2.5 T2=3 
c) sigma = 4 T1=1 T2 = 7
for part one low sigma wa chosen as the edges were sharp and there was no flactuations in grey values other than the edges and because of this no presmoothening is needed
for peppers photo there's lots of texture and becasue of this presmoothening with large sigma is needed. also there's lots of small edges and them we need  high value for T2 to get only the True edges and small value for T1 to get thier extensions correclty.
d) sigma = 5 T1=3 T2=4.5
