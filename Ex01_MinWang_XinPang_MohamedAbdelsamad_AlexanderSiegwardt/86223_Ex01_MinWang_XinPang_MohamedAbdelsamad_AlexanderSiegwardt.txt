 Exercise 4: (11/12)
    a) Ok
    b) Using multiplication to calculate a square is usually faster than using pow
    You are not summing up the mse values. You should use += instead of = or 
    mse = mse + ... (-1P)
    c) Ok.
    The measured MSE and PSNR values are not correct, see b, but since this is a follow up mistake, no points subtracted.
    In general, you shouldn't use jpg to store picture where you want to show what your algorithms do since jpg adds compression artefacts.
    png would probably be better suited for such a task.

Exercise 5: (4/6)
	5a) 1/2
	The point in the centre corresponds to a frequency of 0 (rescaled average grey value).
	The other two (symmetric) points correspond to the single frequency ("the wave") from the image.

	5b) 1/2
	Gaussian is cut off at the image boundary, cutt-of errors at the boundaries

	5c) 2/2
	Some beams do not go out radially from the center.
	They are the result of high frequencies which don't fit in the Fourier spectrum
